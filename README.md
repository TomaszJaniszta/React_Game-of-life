#  1.Bouncing ball
Create bouncy simulator. Get board from ExampleInput.js. X – border, 0 – boards object can travel, 1 – bouncing object. 
The program is to show how the object would travel and bounce against the walls. 

# 2.Chess board
Program is to choose at random one of the chess piece (except the pawn) and place it at the random spot on the board. 
After placing any piece (except first one) check all present pieces move ranges and see if any can reach other piece. 
If so Give that pieces position and quit program. FACTORY (with class hierarhy) + SINGLETON pattern

# 3.Game of life
The game of life - one of the first and most famous examples of a cellular automaton, invented in 1970 by the British mathematician John Conway.
The game is played on a board divided into square cells. Each cell has eight "neighbors" (the so-called Moore's neighborhood),
i.e. cells adjacent to it with sides and corners. Each cell can be in one of two states: it can be either "alive" (on) or "dead".
Cell states change over time. The state of all cells in one unit of time is used to calculate the state of all cells in the next unit.
After the calculation, all cells change their state at exactly the same time. The state of a cell depends only on the number of its living neighbors.
There are no players in the game in the literal sense of the word. Human participation comes down to establishing the initial state of cells.
A dead cell that has exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive in the next unit of time (is born).
A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors remains alive, and with a different number of neighbors it dies (from "loneliness" or "crowding").
